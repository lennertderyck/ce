                Custom Elements is not just another library or framework, other than Bootstrap or Spectre this library of css-classes is meant for supporting webdevelopers in making small changes of elements, helping them writing less css.
            </p>
            <p>
                The library contains classes that only change some characteristcs of an element.
                It's very helpful when you're writing code and only have to change one or two, or even a small group of elements, so you won't have to dive in youre css-file and search for selectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developted the code in the first place for myself because I noticed I wrote the same css-code in some projects over and over, so making one library of classes whas a whole lot 
                more efficient.
