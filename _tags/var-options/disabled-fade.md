full-name: Fading of disabled element with 'disabled'-class
class-name: disabled-fade
init-value: unset
---
Can be set to a number between 1 and 0. The number describes how much of the element is still visible, not how much it's faded.

Example: the number 0.5 will fade the object for 50%, but 0.25 will fade it for 75%.
```
--{{ page.class-name }}: <value>;
```
